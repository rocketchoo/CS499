This week, I focused on reflecting on my career choice and setting my future direction as I near the end of the Computer Science program. I needed to trace the development of my career plans from the start of the program until now. This involved writing a journal entry that answers four key questions: whether I have changed my career plans and what prompted any changes, how my thinking about my career has evolved, any research I have done about my career choice and its impact on my thinking, and whether I have considered pursuing an advanced degree or certification after my undergraduate degree. Additionally, I had to reflect on which course outcomes I have achieved so far and which ones I still need to work on.

In the second part of the assignment, I provided an update on my progress with each category of artifacts for my ePortfolio. This included three categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. I documented my progress in a Status Checkpoints table, noting the status of each category, completed enhancements, upcoming tasks, and any challenges I am facing. This table helps to clearly communicate my progress and any areas where I may need assistance.

For the final project, I am tasked with creating a professional ePortfolio that showcases my skills and abilities from the Computer Science program. This includes an artifact demonstrating my skills in algorithms and data structures. I have previously selected an artifact in this category and completed a code review, planning enhancements to the code. In Milestone Three, I need to perform the planned enhancements, develop a narrative explaining why I selected this artifact and the skills showcased in enhancing it, and submit the artifact and narrative for instructor review and comments. After receiving feedback, I will incorporate the instructorâ€™s comments and polish the artifact before publishing it in my ePortfolio. This process ensures that my ePortfolio effectively demonstrates my knowledge and skills to potential employers.
