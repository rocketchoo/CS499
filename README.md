This week, I need to discuss two emerging trends or developments in computer science. I will choose two trends and write a journal entry answering five questions about each trend. These questions include the significance of each trend, how each trend will change the field of computer science, how each trend will change the experience of consumers, workers, or citizens, how each trend fits with my career interests or aspirations, and which course outcomes I have achieved so far and which ones remain.

In the second part of the assignment, I will provide an update on my progress with each category of artifacts for my ePortfolio. The categories include Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. I will document my progress in a Status Checkpoints table, noting the status of each category, completed enhancements, upcoming tasks, and any challenges I am facing.

For the final project, I am tasked with creating a professional ePortfolio that showcases my skills and abilities from the Computer Science program. This ePortfolio includes an artifact demonstrating my skills and abilities in databases. I have previously selected an artifact in this category and completed a code review, planning enhancements to the code. In Milestone Four, I need to perform the planned enhancements, develop a narrative explaining why I selected this artifact and the skills showcased in enhancing it, and submit the artifact and narrative for instructor review and comments.
