For this module, I had to do the following: 
Write a journal entry answering four questions about using an ePortfolio for self-promotion, mitigating risks, possible downsides, and course outcomes achieved.
Provide an update on my progress in three categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.
Complete a Status Checkpoints table documenting my progress, including completed tasks, upcoming tasks, and any challenges faced.
