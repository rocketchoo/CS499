For this assignment, I conducted a comprehensive code review of the work I selected for enhancement in my ePortfolio. The task was divided into two parts.

In Part 1, I explored the concept of code review, its significance in software development, and best practices. I discussed why code review is essential for identifying errors, improving code quality, and ensuring adherence to industry standards. I also outlined key best practices, such as reviewing code early in the development process, maintaining clear and constructive feedback, and focusing on security, readability, and efficiency.

In Part 2, I selected a screencasting tool to record my code review and developed an outline to guide my review process. I structured my analysis around three key areas based on the rubric and the code review checklist. My review critically analyzed my existing code, highlighting areas for improvement and aligning my planned enhancements with the course outcomes.

This milestone served as a foundation for future enhancements in CS 499, helping me identify improvement areas while demonstrating my skills in software engineering, database management, security, and algorithmic problem-solving.
